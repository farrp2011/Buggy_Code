	   Lab 3 BuggyPage problem
	   As provided, this file has bugs. Find and fix them
	   so that the output given David Jon Hendricks displays
	   "Your name is: David J. Hendricks".
	   
	   You can assume that the user will input only and always
	   three names (challenge: already have programming down?
	   make the page resilient to bad form inputs also)
